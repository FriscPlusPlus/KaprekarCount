# What is this?

I have no idea, i am very confused and can not think properly as of next week i have the first 4 exams that will determine my future and i still did not study, no its 5:42 AM and i still did not sleep because of my anxiety so i ended up doing nothing the whole day except Djing and programming.

# Why Kaprekar?

I was laying in bad and scrolling through reddit on the sub r/TikTokCringe and stumbled on this [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/ufgw4y/kaprekars_constant/), while watching it i was thinking on what i can do with what i just learned if i programmed it (professional deformation).

# Techno & Coding

So i also uploaded my live set from today on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jey01/my-live-set) if you want to listen to it. 

# How to use this class? 

Do you really need to? If yes then quick example:

```js

const KaprekarCount = require('../index');
const Kaprekar = new KaprekarCount();
const cycle = Kaprekar.cycle(2342);
const cycle = Kaprekar.cycleCount(2342);
console.log(cycle); // will log the array with the numbers of the cycle
console.log(count); // literally the length of the array lol


```
